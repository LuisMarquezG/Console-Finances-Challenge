# Console Finances Challenge

## Description

The task is to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company, I guess should have functions to do it more efficiently but I did not want to investigate to do it because I prefer to work with the skills that I have learned during this week.

  In this challenge, I have been investigating by myself a few new things to complete it. Also, I had to ask a friend who is an accountant how they do that calculation to try to understand how to start to code.
  On the other hand, when I was almost finished I was unable to make the code work and I asked a friend for help, he revised my code and suggested I should use and read about `(...)`, to be honest, without his help I think I am never would found where the problem was. That is why I want to start the things that I have learned with... 
  - The spread syntax`(...)` Although I am not very clear about how it works, I can understand that lets me fill a space in the var where a value was expected to be.
  - I learned about `.push()` because let me add a new element to the array called changes when I was calculating the changes in profit and loss. I need to do that that array will help me to calculate the average.
  - I have learned, and probably it was the easiest, the methods `Math.max` and `Math.mix` which return the maximum/minimum figures respectively and those were crucial to have the results for the greatest increase and decrease.
  - `indexOf()` shows me where to find the figure that I need in the array.
  - I have learned that I can use `toFixed()` to control how many decimals I want to show in a figure.
  - I have learned how to add images to the `README` file.
  - I have learned how to use Template Literal and I think is more easy to use than String Concatenation.

## Logic

  - Heading.
     - I have put the title of the exercise into a var called `title`.
        ![Variable title's screenshot](assets/images/code-screenshots/title-1)
  - Calculating the number of elements in the array.
  - Calculating the gross amount.
  - Calculating the changes in profit/losses.
  - Calculate the average of the changes in profit/losses.
  - Calculating the greatest increase in profits/losses.
  - Calculating the greatest decrease in profit/losses.
  - Output.
